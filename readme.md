# GraphQL 

## What is GraphQL 
<p style="font-family: monoco">Graphql is a <span style="text-decoration: "underline">query language for APIs</span> and <span>a runtime</span> for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of your data in your API, gives the client the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables the power of developer tools.</p>
