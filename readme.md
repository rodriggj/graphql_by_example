# GraphQL 

## What is GraphQL 
Graphql is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of your data in your API, gives the client the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables the power of developer tools.

## Why do you need GraphQL (as opposed to using REST or other query languages...)
1. You can query for exactly what you need (no Overfetching). 
    ::: primary
    The client (not the server) will dictate exactly what is needed in the API request.
    :::

2. Get many resources in a single request
